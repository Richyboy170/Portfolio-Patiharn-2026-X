I have been actively involved in church life for over 20 years, regularly attending services and participating in various ministries. I serve on the worship team, contributing as a bassist, guitarist, violinist, singer, and occasionally as a worship leader. Over the years, I have also participated in numerous church camps and spiritual retreats, which have helped strengthen both my faith and leadership skills.
